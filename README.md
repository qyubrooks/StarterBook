# StarterBook

## Background

Over two billion dollars have been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the over 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick to finding success.

# Objectives

This is an Excel Analysis of four thousand past Kickstarter projects to uncover hidden trends by examining the funding process and success rate.

# Instructions

* Using the Excel table provided, you will be modifying and analyzing the data of four thousand past Kickstarter projects as you attempt to uncover some of the market trends.

* Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the `state` column with a different color, depending on whether the associated campaign was "successful," "failed," "cancelled," or is currently "live".

* Create a new column at column O called `percent funded` that uses a formula to uncover how much money a campaign made towards reaching its initial goal.

  * Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the `percent funded` column using a three-color scale. The scale should start at 0 and be a dark shade of red, transitioning to green at 100, and then moving towards blue at 200.

* Create a new column at column P called `average donation` that uses a formula to uncover how much each backer for the project paid on average.

* Create two new columns, one called `category` at Q and another called `sub-category` at R, which use formulas to split the `Category and Sub-Category` column into two parts.

  * Create a new sheet with a pivot table that will analyze your initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were "successful," "failed," "cancelled," or are currently "live" per **category**.

    * Create a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by `country` based on the table you have created.

  * Create a new sheet with a pivot table that will analyze your initial sheet to count how many campaigns were "successful," "failed," "cancelled," or are currently "live" per **sub-category**.

    * Create a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by `country` and `parent-category` based on the table you have created.

* The dates stored within the `deadline` and `launched_at` columns are using unix timestamps. Fortunately for us, [there is a formula](http://spreadsheetpage.com/index.php/tip/converting_unix_timestamps/) out there that can be used to convert these timestamps into a normal date.

  * Create a new column named `Date Created Conversion` that will use [this formula](http://spreadsheetpage.com/index.php/tip/converting_unix_timestamps/) to convert the data contained within `launched_at` into Excel's Date format

  * Create a new column named `Date Ended Conversion` that will use [this formula](http://spreadsheetpage.com/index.php/tip/converting_unix_timestamps/) to convert the data contained within `deadline` into Excel's Date format

  * Create a new sheet with a pivot table with a column of `state`, rows of `Date Created Conversion`, values based on the count of `state`, and filters based on `parent category` and `Years`.

  * Now create a pivot chart line graph that visualizes this new table.


* Create a new sheet with 8 columns: `Goal`, `Number Successful`, `Number Failed`, `Number Canceled`, `Total Projects`, `Percentage Successful`, `Percentage Failed`, and `Percentage Canceled`

  * In the `goal` column, create twelve rows with the following headers...

    * Less Than 1000
    * 1000 to 4999
    * 5000 to 9999
    * 10000 to 14999
    * 15000 to 19999
    * 20000 to 24999
    * 25000 to 29999
    * 30000 to 34999
    * 35000 to 39999
    * 40000 to 44999
    * 45000 to 49999
    * Greater than or equal to 50000

  * Using the `COUNTIFS()` formula, count how many successful, failed, and canceled projects were created with goals within those ranges listed above. Populate the `Number Successful`, `Number Failed`, and `Number Canceled` columns with this data.

  * Add up each of the values in the `Number Successful`, `Number Failed`, and `Number Canceled` columns to populate the `Total Projects` column. Then, using a mathematic formulae, find the percentage of projects which were successful, failed, or were canceled per goal range.

  * Create a line chart which graphs the relationship between a goal's amount and its chances at success, failure, or cancellation.

# Three conclusions:

After doing the above instructions, I got three pivot tables and charts. We can easily find out theater and music are the two most successful categories in Kickstarter campaigns. We can recognize plays and rock are the most successful topics under the theater and music categories. In addition, Kickstarter campaigns started on May seems to be the most successful. There are more Kickstarter campaigns would be canceled on July. According to Outcomes Based on Goal Line Chart, higher goal doesn’t lead to higher success.

# Some of the limitations of this dataset:
One limitation of this dataset is population. We don’t know how many total people are involved from each country. Maybe some small counties have less population, but more people are involved to pledge. Another limitation is the different exchange rate of currency. Because of different exchange rate, a large amount of pledges doesn’t necessarily mean more money. Maybe science fiction shows start in the morning, so less people are able to watch. That is why it failed.

# Considerations:
We can create exchange rate columns. It will exchange the amount of goal from different currencies to be the same. That will be help us judge the amount of pledges. We can also make a bar chart to compare different categories in the same month. It can help us understand which month what types of Kickstarter campaigns are more popular and successful.
